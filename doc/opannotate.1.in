.SH NAME
opannotate \- produce source or assembly annotated with profile data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B opannotate
[
.I options
]
[profile specification]
.SH DESCRIPTION

.B opannotate
outputs annotated source and/or assembly from profile data of an OProfile
session. See oprofile(1) for how to write profile specifications.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "--assembly / -a"
Output annotated assembly. The binary file to be annotated does not need full debugging
information to use this option, but symbol information
.I is
required. Without symbol information,
.B opannotate
will silently refuse to annotate the binary.
If this option is combined with --source, then mixed
source / assembly annotations are output.
.br
.TP
.BI "--demangle / -D none|smart|normal"
none: no demangling. normal: use default demangler (default) smart: use
pattern-matching to make C++ symbol demangling more readable.
.br
.TP
.BI "--exclude-dependent / -x"
Do not include application-specific images for libraries, kernel modules
and the kernel. This option only makes sense if the profile session
used --separate.
.br
.TP
.BI "--exclude-file [files]"
Exclude all files in the given comma-separated list of glob patterns. This option
is supported solely with the
.I --source
option. It can be used to filter out source files in the output using the
following types of specifications:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
filenames (basename -- i.e., no path)
.IP \(bu 2
filename glob specifications (all files whose base filename matches the given pattern)
.IP \(bu 2
directory segments (all source files located in the specified directory; e.g. "libio")
.IP \(bu 2
directory segment glob specifications (e.g., "libi*")
.RE
.br
.TP
.BI "--exclude-symbols / -e [symbols]"
Exclude all the symbols in the given comma-separated list.
.br
.TP
.BI "--help / -? / --usage"
Show help message.
.br
.TP
.BI "--image-path / -p [paths]"
Comma-separated list of additional paths to search for binaries.
This is needed to find modules in kernels 2.6 and upwards.
.br
.TP
.BI "--root / -R [path]"
A path to a filesystem to search for additional binaries.
.br
.TP
.BI "--include-file [files]"
Only include files in the given comma-separated list of glob patterns.
The same rules apply for this option as for the
.I --exclude-file
option.
.br
.TP
.BI "--merge / -m [lib,cpu,tid,tgid,unitmask,all]"
Merge any profiles separated in a --separate session.
.br
.TP
.BI "--include-symbols / -i [symbols]"
Only include symbols in the given comma-separated list.
.br
.TP
.BI "--objdump-params [params]"
Pass the given parameters as extra values when calling objdump.  If more than
one option is to be passed to objdump, the parameters must be enclosed in a
quoted string.

An example of where this option is useful is when your toolchain does not
automatically recognize instructions that are specific to your processor.
For example, on IBM POWER7/RHEL 6, objdump must be told that a binary file may have
POWER7-specific instructions. The opannotate option to show the POWER7-specific
instructions is:
   --objdump-params=-Mpower7

The opannotate option to show the POWER7-specific instructions,
the source code (--source) and the line numbers (-l) would be:
   --objdump-params="-Mpower7 -l --source"

.br
.TP
.BI "--output-dir / -o [dir]"
Output directory. This makes opannotate output one annotated file for each
source file. This option can't be used in conjunction with --assembly.
.br
.TP
.BI "--search-dirs / -d [paths]"
Comma-separated list of paths to search for source files. You may need to use
this option when the debug information for an image contains relative paths.
.br
.TP
.BI "--base-dirs / -b [paths]"
Comma-separated list of paths to strip from debug source files, prior to
looking for them in --search-dirs.
.br
.TP
.BI "--session-dir="dir_path
Use sample database from the specified directory
.I dir_path
instead of the default location. If
.I --session-dir
is not specified, then
.B opannotate
will search for samples in <current_dir>/oprofile_data
first. If that directory does not exist, the standard session-dir of /var/lib/oprofile is used.
.br
.TP
.BI "--source / -s"
Output annotated source. This requires debugging information to be available
for the binaries.
.br
.TP
.BI "--threshold / -t [percentage]"
For annotated assembly, only output data for symbols that have more than the given percentage
of total samples. For profiles using multiple events, if the threshold is reached
for any event, then all sample data for the symbol is shown.

For annotated source, only output data for source files that have more than the given percentage
of total samples. For profiles using multiple events, if the threshold is reached
for any event, then all sample data for the source file is shown.
.br
.TP
.BI "--verbose / -V [options]"
Give verbose debugging output.
.br
.TP
.BI "--version / -v"
Show version.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
No special environment variables are recognised by opannotate.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I <session_dir>/samples
The location of the generated sample files.
